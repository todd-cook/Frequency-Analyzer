Frequency-Analyzer
==================

This Frequency-Analyzer library provides many of the basic methods for dissecting and analyzing
a cryptogram or a body of text. Frequency analysis is an important technique for cryptanalysis
and computational linguistics.

Although many cryptography books were consulted in writing this code, such as: "Cryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution" by Helen F. Gaines, there was no existing easy to use and lightweight library for doing automatic solutions. 

Provided Examples
-----------------
* Automatic encryption/decryption of substitution ciphers
* Encryption help with/attempted automated decryption of Vigenere ciphers
* Automatically solving a shredder puzzle (see unit test: ShredderSolverTest)
